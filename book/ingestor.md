# Ingestor

The goal of the ingestor is to act as server component in the OpenTelemetry Protocol (OLTP) [Specification](https://opentelemetry.io/docs/specs/otlp/). The payload is based on Protocol Buffer Schemas defined [here](https://github.com/open-telemetry/opentelemetry-proto/tree/main/opentelemetry/proto).

This chapter aims to present which features the ingestor implements to reach the goal of full OLTP server compliance, but also how they can be configured.

### Transport

OLTP supports a wide-variety of transportation methods summarized in the following table:

| System    | HTTP     | Content-Type             | Supported |
|---        |---       |---                       |:-:        |
| OLTP/gRPC | HTTP/2   | `application/x-protobuf` |âœ…         |
| OLTP/HTTP | HTTP/1.1 | `application/x-protobuf` |ðŸš§         |
| OLTP/HTTP | HTTP/2   | `application/x-protobuf` |ðŸš§         |
| OLTP/HTTP | HTTP/1.1 | `application/json`       |ðŸš§         |
| OLTP/HTTP | HTTP/2   | `application/json`       |ðŸš§         |

#### System

##### OLTP/gRPC

Default port is `4317`.
